# Time-Series-Forecasting-Coded-Project
Forecasting Wine Sales for ABC Estate Wines company
Course: Time Series Forecasting
Analyzed historical monthly sales data of a company. Created multiple forecast models for two different products of a particular Wine Estate and recommended the optimum forecasting model to predict monthly sales for the next 12 months along with appropriate lower and upper confidence limits.

Skills & Tools Covered:
Exploratory Data Analysis on time series data
Decomposition
stationary check
Moving Average
Exponential models
ARIMA
SARIMA
My Learnings:
üìÖ 1. Time Series Data Handling: Developed skills in working with monthly sales data and recognizing patterns like trend, seasonality, and randomness. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tailored for time series, including time plots, autocorrelation (ACF/PACF), and seasonal plots. üîç 2. Decomposition & Stationarity Check: Learned how to decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components to understand underlying patterns. Understood the importance of stationarity for modeling, and applied techniques such as: Rolling statistics Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test Differencing to stabilize the series. üìà 3. Forecasting Models and Techniques: Gained hands-on experience in building and comparing various time series models, including: Simple and Weighted Moving Average models Exponential Smoothing methods (like SES and Holt-Winters) ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) for handling seasonality. Learned to tune model parameters using ACF/PACF plots and validation metrics. üßÆ 4. Model Evaluation & Forecasting: Evaluated models based on metrics like AIC, BIC, RMSE, and forecast accuracy. Recommended the best-fit forecasting model for each product. Generated 12-month forecasts with appropriate confidence intervals, supporting better business planning. üõ†Ô∏è 5. Tools & Technical Skills: Strengthened proficiency in Python libraries such as: pandas and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization statsmodels and pmdarima for modeling Applied time series theory to real-world business forecasting problems. üí° Overall Takeaway: Learned how to transform historical time series data into reliable sales forecasts using advanced models like ARIMA and SARIMA. This project strengthened ability to apply statistical forecasting techniques for demand planning and data-driven decision-making in real business contexts.
